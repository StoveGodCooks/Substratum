Trade Me Bro: start → finish steps
Phase 0 — Setup (10–15 min)

Pick your stack: plain HTML/CSS/JS (fastest for this)

Create the project folder and basic file map:

pages: Home, Shop, Product, Cart, Checkout, Success

shared: styles + scripts

Decide the store “rules” (simple):

product types (games, consoles, accessories)

condition (New / Pre-Owned)

stock states (In / Low / Out)

optional membership pricing (Regular vs Pro)

Phase 1 — UI mock (looks real before it works)

Goal: everything looks like a retail site even if buttons do nothing yet.

Build the global layout:

Top promo strip

Header (logo, search, nav, cart icon)

Footer

Build the Home page sections:

Hero promo banner

Featured deals grid

Category tiles

Trade-in callout strip

Build a product card component (visually consistent):

image, title, platform, condition badge, price/pro price, stock label, CTA

Phase 2 — Mock inventory becomes real data (still no backend)

Goal: inventory comes from one data source.

Make a single inventory file (a list of products):

id/sku, name, price, proPrice, condition, platform, stock, tags, image path

Render “Featured” and “Shop grid” from that data

Add basic search/filter UX (even if it’s minimal):

platform filter, condition filter, sort (price/name)

Phase 3 — Cart system (core functionality)

Goal: browse → add → cart works reliably.

Add “Add to cart” behavior from:

Home cards

Shop cards

Product detail page

Store cart in browser storage (so refresh doesn’t wipe it)

Cart page supports:

quantity up/down

remove item

subtotal

stock validation (if stock is 0, prevent add)

Phase 4 — Product detail page (PDP)

Goal: product?id=SKU loads the right item.

Clicking a product opens a PDP

PDP shows:

gallery image, name, badges, stock, description, price tiers

recommended items (same platform/tag)

Phase 5 — Mock checkout (no Stripe yet)

Goal: checkout feels legit without real payments.

Checkout page includes:

shipping form (name, address, email)

order summary (items, subtotal)

“Pay (Test)” button

Clicking “Pay (Test)”:

validates form

“processing” state

routes to Success page

Phase 6 — Success / receipt page

Goal: portfolio “order complete” moment.

Generate:

fake order number

timestamp

receipt layout with totals

Clear cart after success

Phase 7 — Polish (what makes it feel professional)

Empty states:

empty cart

no search results

Loading states (light)

Responsive pass (mobile header + nav)

Accessibility basics:

focus outlines, button labels, contrast

Phase 8 — Replace mock pay with Stripe test (later)

Add a tiny backend (serverless function)

Create Stripe Checkout session from cart items

Redirect to Stripe hosted checkout

Return to success/cancel URLs

Optional: webhook for “payment confirmed”

Folder structure you’ll end up with

(Structure only — no code)

index.html (Home)

shop.html (Inventory)

product.html (PDP)

cart.html

checkout.html (mock now, Stripe later)

success.html

assets/ (images, icons)

css/ (styles)

js/ (logic: UI helpers, cart, pages)

data/ (products inventory)

The “right order” to build files (so you don’t get stuck)

Home page UI (static)

Shared header/footer

Product card UI

Inventory data file

Shop page grid from data

Cart logic

Product page

Checkout mock

Success receipt

Polish
